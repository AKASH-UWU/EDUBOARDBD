**EDUBOARDBD** is an automation tool designed to scrape academic results from Bangladesh's education boards. It dynamically solves CAPTCHAs using Chrome DevTools Protocol (DP) and retrieves results based on user-provided criteria. Configurations are fetched dynamically from a server-side API to adapt to website updates, ensuring long-term reliability.
